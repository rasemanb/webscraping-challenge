# webscraping-challenge

# Background

You’re now ready to take on the full web-scraping and data analysis project
for the mission to Mars. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a
page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to
extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML
parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of
information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like
multiple news articles on a webpage.

As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same
core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data,
organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually
communicating your insights.

# Tasks

For this assignment, we were tasked with creating 2 different deliverables
by scraping two different websites.

Our first deliverable required us to scrape titles and preview text from a 
website with information on Mars. 

Our second deliverable required us to scrape and analyze Mars' weather data
and export the cleaned data into a csv.

    # Questions to answer

    1. How many months exist on Mars?
    2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the
    scraped dataset?
    3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location
    of Curiosity)?
        - Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the
        months.
        - Plot the results as a bar chart.
    4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on
    Mars?
        - Find the average the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
        - Plot the results as a bar chart.
    5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
        - Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars
        circles the Sun once.
        - Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum
        temperature.
